             <p>It is our pleasure to come with the Pokhara Tourism Council official website. We are hopeful that it will support the promotion of tourism in the region and the country. Known as the land of paradise, Pokhara is really famous for its natural beauty, cultural varieties and for attractive events and activities .Previously the country passed through a turbulent situation disturbing almost all the nerves of our nation for some years. Before the time of recovery period, the country witnessed the problem of earth quake and now again with border blockade, which ultimately hampered all the economic activities including the tourism of Nepal. Despite these problems and turbulences, the country succeeded to achieve the new constitution from the constituent assembly.</p>
             <p>It will certainly help to create a peaceful socio situation and dynamism for the economic activity in the country and hope that the tourism will revive very soon. Of course, there is always light after the dark, i.e. “Rays of Hope.” No doubt, Pokhara is equipped with all amenities for adventure and holiday lovers. But still it is lacking with some important infrastructures like, Pokhara International Airport, Pokhara Bus Park,Walking trail around the Fewa lake, Expansion of high way road to Kathmandu, Sunauli and Corrala border( China ) and most importantly National Carrier should be strengthen which certainly can support to boost the tourism in Pokhara and the country. On behalf of Pokhara Tourism Council, I would like to express my thanks to International Labour Organization (ILO) and ILO Japan for their support for LED Project (Local Economic Development). We expect that this website will definitely help to enhance the tourism by providing reliable and constructive information about Pokhara and the region and also promote tourism awareness among the people and its professionals.</p>
             <p>Thank You</p>
